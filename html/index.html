                Have you ever found it difficult to find the premium quality hair products you deserve? We know this struggle better than most, and all too often, existing solutions can seem “run of the mill” or generic, with little to differentiate them from the norm. This was where we set out to specialize, though, and so our brand was born to help add value to the sector and ensure customers have access to the premium hair products they deserve.
                    Reliable Solutions for Every Customer

                    Macadamia nuts contain over 75% of their weight as oil, the remainder is: 9.0% protein, 9.3% carbohydrates, 1.5% moisture, 1.6% mineral matter and 2.0% fiber. Macadamia kernels contain vitamin A1, B1, B2, niacin and essential elements such as calcium, iron, phosphorus, magnesium and potassium. The oil is a triglyceride and contains primarily monounsaturated fats up to 80–84%. Macadamia oil contains the highest percentage of monounsaturates when compared to both olive and canola oils.
